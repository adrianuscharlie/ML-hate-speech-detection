Create deep learning model for hate speech detection using LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM layer on Selena Gomez phenomenon.

## Features
- Tools
- Dataset
- Preprocessing
- Modelling


## Tools
Tools that are used to do this sentiment analysis are:
- VSCode/Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Tweepy
- Vader Lexicon
- Tensorflow
- 


## Dataset
Dataset that used is taken from scrapping from Twitter using python modul tweepy. Using tweepy and Twitter Developer Account to search tweets that contains "Selena Gomez" words in certain time. After that, save the scrapped data into excel file.
Here's some example of the dataset that taken from Twitter using tweepy module.
Here is the dataset link [Dataset Link](https://github.com/adrianuscharlie/ML-hate-speech-detection/blob/main/Selena%20Gomez/selenagomez.xlsx)

After collect data and do the preprocessing, need to labelling the data using Vader Lexicon. You can access the Vader documentation [here](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment). After labelling the data, we got the labels and add the labels into the dataset like this :
| created at | username | text | preprocessing | labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Thu Mar 02 23:59:30 +0000 2023 | darkonsun | social media is a disease and this hailey bieber selena gomez tea is too hot | social media diseas hailey bieber selena gomez tea hot | Neutral
| Thu Mar 02 23:56:18 +0000 2023 | babyyyannieee | Justin Bieber &amp; Selena Gomez followed each other on Twitter ðŸ˜­teenage me is crying ðŸ˜­ | justin bieber amp selena gomez follow twitter teenag cri | Neutral | Thu Mar 02 23:55:57 +0000 2023 | likabeast10 | Selena Gomez drove by my house ðŸ™€ | selena gomez drive hous | Neutral

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing applied to the dataset is as follows:
- Filtering tweets that contains "RT" words
- Lowercase
- Remove non alphanumeric characters
- Remove unnecessary characters
- Stop word removal
- Stemming
- Lemmatization
